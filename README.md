Language: MATLAB 
IDE: MATLAB R2016b

These are grid cell models and place cell models.

- The grid cell model uses inhibitory continuous attractor networks
- The place cell model uses competitive learning networks based on Hebbian rules 
- From grid to place cell model, Grid cell models are connected to place cell models as input modules

Check the references to understand the principles.
